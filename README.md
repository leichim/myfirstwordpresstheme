## Recommended Knowledge
* Recommended size for small images in the slider are 960 * 480, the large slider automatically resizes area to screen height minus header. Please be aware that the focal point of images is within this frame.
* Recommended size for images used as feature image, which will then also be used for creating thumbnails, is 630*372, 
otherwhise they will be cropped automatically.
* When switching themes, the data from custom post types and metaboxes will be still in the database, but will not appear in your dashboard anymore.
* When entering urls for example slider images, please fill in the complete url including http://.
* Most javascripts are entered in one single file, functions.js
